#C Is For Coding

A playground for my weekend C experiments.

## Reasons to learn C:

### Broaden Your Thinking
From The Pragmatic Programmer, Tip #8 "Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio":

>  Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. Additionally, learning many languages is far easier now, thanks to the wealth of freely available software on the Internet

### Meet New People
Start looking for folks around you who can answer questions about C. Then try a
local C Meetup. Then get on IRC. You'll learn faster and make friends.

### New Opportunities
[By every measure of popularity][readwriteweb-language-popularity], C/C++/C#
are in the top 5 most needed programming languages. There are plenty of
opportunities to use C.

### Learning Is Fun
Why do people climb Mt. Everest? Or run 100 Miles in 24 hours?
**Because it's there.** Learn a C because you want to.
